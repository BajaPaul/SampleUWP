# SampleUWP
This is a sample UWP App that has a very nice hamburger menu that I spent considerable time setting up but never used so may be useful to others.

This App uses the C# Win2D NuGet package by Microsoft for graphical output on various pages.

This App requires library files LibNumerics.cs, LibUnitConversions.cs, and LibUtilitiesMisc.cs located in 
Library-Files-for-other-Repository-Apps to be linked under folder named 'Libraries' to compile.

I no longer intend to support this App so placing code on GitHub so others can use if useful.
